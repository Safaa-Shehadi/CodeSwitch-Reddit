## CodeSwitch-Reddit

CodeSwitch Reddit corpus collection, pre-processing and analysis is described in the paper:
"CodeSwitch-Reddit: Exploration of Written Multilingual Discourse in Online Discussion Forums", Rabinovich et al., 2019.

The full dataset is available at http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~ella/code-switch.reddit.tar.gz.

**cs_main_reddit_corpus.csv**: the main dataset comprising English-{Tagalog, Greek, Romanian, Indonesian, Russian} code-switched posts, detected with high accuracy (refer to the paper for details).

**cs_additional_reddit_corpus.csv**: additional dataset comprising English-{Spanish, Turkish, Arabic, Croatian, Albanian} code-switched posts. Despite its lower (true code-switching) accuracy, we recognize the potential usefulness of this additional data, and release it as an addendum to our main corpus, for possible further cleanup and preprocessing.

**eng_monolingual_reddit_corpus.csv**: monolingual English posts from the set of country-specific subreddits.
